Using OpenFrameworks as a base, we create a series of interactive installations for testing at the Tuke Special school.

"Tuke meets the needs of students aged 11 years - 19 years with severe, profound and complex learning disabilities.

The school will provide for the needs of students with complex and multiple impairments which includes severe physical disabilities, fine and gross motor difficulties, severe intellectual and / or sensory impairment, developmental delay and extreme communication difficulties as well as challenging behaviours."

Supported by Sound and Music.
